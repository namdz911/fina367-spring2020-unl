### Option Payoff/Profit example

[![alt text](./pic/test2.png)](https://use.vg/i2TvPm)

> Consider a call option on bond X with an exercise price of \\$112 that expires in 3 months. Today the option price is \$4.
> 1. What is your payoff if you buy the option today and in 3 months bond X is selling for \$100? What is your profit/loss?
> 2. What is your payoff if you sell the option and in 3 months bond X is selling for \$100? What is your profit/loss?
> 3. What is your payoff if you buy the option and in 3 months bond X is selling for \$120? What is your profit/loss?

#### Solution
1. The option will not be exercise because the strike price \$112 is higher than market price \$100. You lose the \$4 you paid for the option.
2. In this case, you gain 4 for selling the option.
3. The option will be exercise because the strike price \$112 is lower than market price \$120. You lose the \$4 you paid for the option but gain \$8 (120-112) for exercising the option.
