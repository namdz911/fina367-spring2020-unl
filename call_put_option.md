>Consider a call option on bond X with an exercise price of \$112 that expires in 3 months. Today the option’s price is \$4.
> - What is your payoff if you buy the option today and in 3 months bond X is selling for \$100? What is your profit/loss?

##### ![](./pic/light.png) Solution
- Go through this set of questions:
    - Who get to decide? **You**
    - Will it be exercised? **No! because the price at expiration is less than the strike price (100 < 112).**
    - What’s the payoff? **Payoff is 0 because the option is not excercised.**
    - Did you pay or receive the premium? **You paid the premium because you are the buyer**
    - What is the profit/loss? **0 - 4 = -4**

</details> 

#### Practice

- Go through this set of questions:
    - Who get to decide? **Whoever buys the option.**
    - Will it be exercised? **No! because the price at expiration is less than the strike price (100 < 112).**
    - What’s the payoff? **Payoff is 0 because the option is not excercised.**
    - Did you pay or receive the premium? **You receive the premium because you are the seller**
    - What is the profit/loss? **0 + 4 = 4**

##### ![](./pic/light.png) Solution
- Go through this set of questions:
    - Who get to decide? **You**
    - Will it be exercised? **Yes! because the price at expiration is higher than the strike price (120 > 112).**
    - What’s the payoff? **Payoff is 120 - 112 = 8 because the option is not excercised.**
    - Did you pay or receive the premium? **You paid the premium because you are the buyer**
    - What is the profit/loss? **8 - 4 = 4**

## Practice Problems

<a id='problem-1'></a>
#### ![](./pic/note1515.png) Problem 1
You buy a call option and buy a put option on bond X. The strike price of the call option is \$90 and the strike price of the put option is \$90. The call option premium is \$5 and the put option premium is \$2. Both options can be exercised only on their expiration date, which happens to be the same for the call and the put. If the price of bond X is \$100 on the expiration date, what is your total payoff and then total profit from the options portfolio?

<details>
  <summary>Click for Solution!</summary>
    
#### Solution

 - At \$100, the call option would be exercised and the payoff to the buyer would be **100-90=10**.
 - At \$100, the put option will not be exercised and the payoff to the buyer would be **0**.
 - The total payoff from the options portfolio would be **10**.
 - The total profit from the options portfolio is **10-5-2=3**.

#### ![](./pic/note1515.png) Problem 2
Consider a 1-year zero-coupon bond that has a CCC rating. Assume that this bond is senior secured (historical recovery rate = 42.7%). The yield on a 1-year zero-coupon Treasury bond is 2%. What should be the yield on this CCC-rated bond? (Assume periodicity of 1 and probability of default 20%)

<details>

##### ![](./pic/light.png) Solution

- The yield on this CCC-rated bond is **15.02022%**
