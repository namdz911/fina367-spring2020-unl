## Introduction to options
If an asset pays a stream of payoffs over multiple time periods, then we
can use a discount rate to calculate the value to the consumer of a entire
sequence of payoffs.

### Example 1A

> Consider a 1-year zero-coupon bond that has a BBB rating. Assume that this bond is senior secured (historical recovery rate = 63.5%). The yield on a 1-year zero-coupon Treasury bond is 6%. What should be the yield on this BBB-rated bond? (Assume periodicity of 1)

## Bond Factor Models

If an asset pays a stream of payoffs over multiple time periods, then we
can use a discount rate to calculate the value to the consumer of a entire
sequence of payoffs.

\begin{aligned}
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t & = \frac{1}{1-\beta}\\
\sum_{t=0}^{\tau} \beta^t &= \frac{1- \beta^{\tau+1}}{1-\beta}\\

> **EXAMPLE 7**
>
> A bond has an expected return of 17.6%, sensitivity to the term factor of 1.45 and to the default factor of 0.86. The current term risk pr
emium is 3.2%. The risk free rate of return is 5%. What is the default risk premium if no arbitrage opportunities exist?
