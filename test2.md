#### ![](./pic/note1515.png) Problem 1
You buy a call option and buy a put option on bond X. The strike price of the call option is \$90 and the strike price of the put option is \$90. The call option premium is \$5 and the put option premium is \$2. Both options can be exercised only on their expiration date, which happens to be the same for the call and the put. If the price of bond X is \$100 on the expiration date, what is your total payoff and then total profit from the options portfolio?

#### Solution

 - At \$100, the call option would be exercised and the payoff to the buyer would be **100-90=10**.
 - At \$100, the put option will not be exercised and the payoff to the buyer would be **0**.
 - The total payoff from the options portfolio would be **10**.
 - The total profit from the options portfolio is **10-5-2=3**.

#### ![](./pic/note1515.png) Problem 2
You sell a call option and buy a put option on bond X. The strike price of the call option is \$90 and the strike price of the put option is \$105. The call option premium is \$5 and the put option premium is \$2. Both options can be exercised only on their expiration date, which happens to be the same for the call and the put. If the price of bond X is \$100 on the expiration date, what is your total payoff and then total profit from the options portfolio?

##### ![](./pic/light.png) Solution

 - At \$100, the call option would be exercised and the payoff to the seller would be **–(100-90)=-10**.
 - At \$100, the put option will be exercised and the payoff to the buyer would be **105-100=5**
 - The total payoff from the options portfolio would be **-5**.
 - The total profit from the options portfolio is **-5+5-2=-2**. (loss)

#### ![](./pic/note1515.png) Problem 3
Consider an 27 year 12.3 % coupon bond with \$1,000 par selling for \$937 (semi-annual coupons). 
 - Suppose that the first par call for this bond is 1 years from now. 
 - Assume that the bond is putable at par in 17 years. 
 - If the call/put dates above are the only ones, what is the bond’s yield to worst?

##### ![](./pic/light.png) Solution
 - Annualized YTM = **13.1562%**
 - Annualized YTFPC = **19.5374%**
 - Annualized YTFPP = **13.2406%**
 - Notice that there is no YTFC. So just compare the yields that you have to get YTWorst = **13.1562%**
